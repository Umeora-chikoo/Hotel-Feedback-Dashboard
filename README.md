 # Conclusion & Recommendation:
â€¢  **Improve Customer Experience**: A 3.6 rating and low NPS suggest dissatisfaction. The management has to focus on improving consistency in service.                  
    â€¢  **Staff Interaction**: With the highest feedback volume, staff performance needs regular assessment and support as regards Check-in Process and Attitude to customers.      
â€¢  **Enhance Business Services**: Given the high share of business visitors, optimize facility(Broadband, Tv & Gym) for work-focused stays.                               
â€¢  **Revisit Restaurant Strategy**: The lowest engagement area. Evaluate menu( food quality & variety) and service.                                     
â€¢  **Double Down on Digital Acquisition**: SEO, booking partnerships, and online reviews drive visibility, efforts should be scaled up.                                 
 â€¢  **Drop Ineffective Channels**: TV and newspaper ads no longer justify investment.
